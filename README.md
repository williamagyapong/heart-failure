# Predicting Mortality by Heart Failure

According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated
17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths
worlwide. Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart attack and stroke. Heart
failure is a common event caused by cardiovascular diseases.

The early detection of people with cardiovascular diseases or who are at
high cardiovascular risk due to the presence of one or more risk factors
is paramount to reducing deaths arising from heart failures. As a
result, predictive models become indispensable.

The dataset explored in this project contains 12 features that can be
used to predict mortality by heart failure. The goal of this project,
therefore, is to **identify an appropriate classification model that can
accurately predict the survival of patients with heart failure**.

<!-- Various classification models, as can be found in the Predictive Model section of this report, will be explored with the hope of coming up with a model that has high prediction accuracy.  -->
